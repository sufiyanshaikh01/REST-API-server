# What is a REST API?
REST stands for REpresentational State Transfer.<br>
A REST API is a way for different software systems to communicate over the internet using standard HTTP methods.<br>

# Key Features of REST:
Stateless: Server does not store client state. Each request is independent.<br>
Client-Server: Clear separation between frontend (client) and backend (server).<br>
Cacheable: Responses can be stored to improve performance.<br>
Uniform Interface: Standard way to access resources.<br>

# Common Use Cases:
Mobile apps communicating with servers.<br>
Web apps fetching/storing data.<br>
IoT devices sending data to a server.<br>
